# Windows Scripts
- Just a bunch of shortcuts and batch scripts that I use almost everyday
- I just needed a way to sync these between my devices and so here it is! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

## Some useful commands
### Cipher
- cipher /e {Pathtofoldertoencrypt} (Encrypt empty folder)
- cipher /d {Pathtofoldertoencrypt} (Decrypt folder)
- cipher /e /s:{Pathtofoldertoencrypt} (Encrypt folder with files)
- cipher /w:{DirveLetter} (Wipe empty space on drive)

### ipConfig
- ipconfig
- ipconfig /all (nore detail)
- ipconfig /flushdns (flush DNS)
